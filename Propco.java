tenancy life-cycle
===================
Generally speaking, the tenant lifecycle involves seven stages: vacancy, screening, leasing, move-in, 
occupancy, ending tenancy, and move-out.
1. Vacancy -> 
------------
Stage one starts with your property being empty. 
It’s critical that you start things off on the right foot and make sure your property is prepared to 
become someone’s new home. To do that, there are some things you should do:
◙ Clean the unit 
◙ Take high-quality photos of the interior and exterior
◙ Handle any necessary repairs and maintenance issues

2. Screening -> 
----------------
During stage two, it’s time to start your screening process.
Once you’ve started marketing your available rental property, it’s time to start scheduling showings 
and considering potential tenants.

Our four-step screening process includes:
◙ Credit check
◙ Criminal background
◙ Income verification (additional layer of protection)
◙ Rental verification 

3. Leasing -> 
--------------
After you’ve screened qualified applicants and selected a tenant, you’ll need to enter 
into a lease agreement.
◙ This includes creating the lease agreement, scheduling a move-in date, calculating move-in costs, and 
having both parties sign the finalized lease agreement.
◙ It’s best practice to have the tenants sign the lease first and make sure both parties receive a copy of 
the signed lease agreement.

4.Move-in ->
-------------
◙ At this point, you should have agreed on a move-in date with your tenant and collected all applicable
 move-in fees before handing over the keys. 
◙ Review any final rules or regulations and create a plan for when and where your tenant will pick up keys 
 to the property.

5.Occupancy ->
--------------
Hopefully, this is the lifecycle step where you’ll spend most of your time.
◙ Once your tenant has moved into your rental property, your focus should shift to property management and
building a strong landlord-tenant relationship. 
                                  ◙  Consider how you will address any issues that arise like late rent 
payments, tenant complaints, lease violations, or emergency maintenance issues. Plan a regular inspection 
schedule (seasonally is a good place to start) and share the schedule with your tenants.

6. Ending tenancy ->
---------------------
◙ Whenever your lease term ends, you and your tenant have the option to either extend the lease or end your
lease agreement.
◙ If your tenant is interested in sticking around, you can either move to a month-to-month agreement or enter
 into a lease renewal with new dates and terms.
◙ If a tenant intends to move, they must provide you with a letter of intent, and if you are ending the 
tenancy, you must send notice to vacate, usually at a set period of time before the lease ends.

7. Move-out ->
---------------
◙ The move-out process is an important step in wrapping up the lifecycle of one tenant before you move 
on to another. 
◙ Like move-in, provide detailed instructions on logistics and timing for move-out dates, cleaning, and 
 handing off keys.

◙ Conduct a move-out inspection to ensure the tenant has complied with all requirements and note any
 maintenance issues that need to be addressed before another tenant can move in. Calculate and return 
 any security deposits promptly.
