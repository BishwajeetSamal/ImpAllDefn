=========================================**********************=========================================
tenancy life-cycle
===================
Generally speaking, the tenant lifecycle involves seven stages: vacancy, screening, leasing, move-in, 
occupancy, ending tenancy, and move-out.
1. Vacancy -> 
------------
Stage one starts with your property being empty. 
It’s critical that you start things off on the right foot and make sure your property is prepared to 
become someone’s new home. To do that, there are some things you should do:
◙ Clean the unit 
◙ Take high-quality photos of the interior and exterior
◙ Handle any necessary repairs and maintenance issues

2. Screening -> 
----------------
During stage two, it’s time to start your screening process.
Once you’ve started marketing your available rental property, it’s time to start scheduling showings 
and considering potential tenants.

Our four-step screening process includes:
◙ Credit check
◙ Criminal background
◙ Income verification (additional layer of protection)
◙ Rental verification 

3. Leasing -> 
--------------
After you’ve screened qualified applicants and selected a tenant, you’ll need to enter 
into a lease agreement.
◙ This includes creating the lease agreement, scheduling a move-in date, calculating move-in costs, and 
having both parties sign the finalized lease agreement.
◙ It’s best practice to have the tenants sign the lease first and make sure both parties receive a copy of 
the signed lease agreement.

4.Move-in ->
-------------
◙ At this point, you should have agreed on a move-in date with your tenant and collected all applicable
 move-in fees before handing over the keys. 
◙ Review any final rules or regulations and create a plan for when and where your tenant will pick up keys 
 to the property.

5.Occupancy ->
--------------
Hopefully, this is the lifecycle step where you’ll spend most of your time.
◙ Once your tenant has moved into your rental property, your focus should shift to property management and
building a strong landlord-tenant relationship. 
                                  ◙  Consider how you will address any issues that arise like late rent 
payments, tenant complaints, lease violations, or emergency maintenance issues. Plan a regular inspection 
schedule (seasonally is a good place to start) and share the schedule with your tenants.

6. Ending tenancy ->
---------------------
◙ Whenever your lease term ends, you and your tenant have the option to either extend the lease or end your
lease agreement.
◙ If your tenant is interested in sticking around, you can either move to a month-to-month agreement or enter
 into a lease renewal with new dates and terms.
◙ If a tenant intends to move, they must provide you with a letter of intent, and if you are ending the 
tenancy, you must send notice to vacate, usually at a set period of time before the lease ends.

7. Move-out ->
---------------
◙ The move-out process is an important step in wrapping up the lifecycle of one tenant before you move 
on to another. 
◙ Like move-in, provide detailed instructions on logistics and timing for move-out dates, cleaning, and 
 handing off keys.

◙ Conduct a move-out inspection to ensure the tenant has complied with all requirements and note any
 maintenance issues that need to be addressed before another tenant can move in. Calculate and return 
 any security deposits promptly.

                                        Knowledge Transfer(KT)
                                        ======================
Today Purpose is to understand the lifecycle of the tenancy through Propco.
Tenancy Term( a written agreement specifying the terms of the rental or temporary possession of a property.)
==============
Duration/Tenancy term/Period of the tenancy of that property. 

So we will proceed with the term. For a agent we do have a diffrent kinds of terms. It could be 3 Months, 2Years , 1 year or we can create for that.
Suppose If I am an Agent and working for the Product and all the terms i can have which an applicant can choose for.

So how we can as a Agent/as a New Agent we  can say, how we can create a term on Propco.

So to do that we need to Login to the Propco. Today i am using the QA propco with the latest build as 44, this is just for the information.

We are good to go any kind of platform for the propco.
For now we are using the desktop Application.

Moving Next, How we create a term.
The access is generally to the admin person or admin staff.
This is crucuial bit where we have to draftout agreement between an applicant and a property.
All the task is done by the administrator.
If i want to do all these then I should have the admin rights with me.

The can only create the term. We create with option called tools.
Tools is kind of Settings in the Propco Project over here.
Go to TOOLS ->  Data Setup -> Tenancy -> Terms.
-----------------------------------------------
Add New , for that click on Add 
Lets create the duration for the Six Months.
So Six motnth is the duration and rent has to paid monthly.
--------------------
So In our Software, the 1st section is 
Details
======== 
like, *Name: 6Month/Monthly, So here before slash we have duration of the tenancy and after slash pointing to the rent paid in that duration like monthly or Qualterly.
then ,*Description: 6 months is duration and rent needs to paid monthly.
then, *Length: 6 months.
then, *Payment: 1 monthly
then, Laspse To: "Select in Dropdown", means your agreement is about to end and if you want to extends the same agreement
if a tenant have the duration for the 6 months then if he/she  wants to extend the duration for more 6 months
then to do that we have Lapse To field .
then, Apply Tax: "can apply the task" //In india called slabs.
then, a second check box is here (Charge commission on net). //this is for the overall value to what they are paying to and if you want to charge any Agent Commission on it. We can go with this option.
then, Options: Less one day, Invoice for full period, never post after tenancy date, //if i have to pay after 30days then we can pay after 29days (if select the 1st option)
--------------------2nd option (Invoice for full period) -> We can pay for complete Six months or whatever the duration is.
then, Charged In Arr:  Yes or No. //Charged in Arr as in that it should be outstanding as a arrear to the tenant.

Forward Posting Rent
====================
It is here like the pre-payment. Or pay in advance. Paying the rent in advance.
This is generally to allow systems to generate or the rents forward.
Suppose if our tenancy cycle starts with 2nd of April month, Claims is where we start raising the rent from defining rent from one day before.
And Thereafter it will says want to continue till do this time.

Mail Merge
===========
We have agrements printed or we do create the agreements between the tenancy and the landlord. To do that we already
have existing list of agrement letters.
We can select any of the letter from the system and we can add to the process where it has to be  printed.
So first field is 1. Printed at tenancy start (Add or Remove) button.
Once we finished our tenancy that means we have finished confirming our tenancy and then this particular agreement 
will print.
2. Printed at Renewal(Add or Remove) button.
If any tenancy term will get extended then the particular letter will get printed which is to select from 
Initiated Letters where the list of files will be shown.
These are not the uploaded basically but it will give you the list of the Agreement type in the mail merge.
We can create the letters.
Here we do have the letter type. Letter type is like Tenlad Letter(need to confirm) and anathor is the Implement Letter(need to confirm).
If the letter type is Agreement then it start showing in the list (Initiated Letters).

Task List
==========
Task List is generally for the Reminders, Here we can remind to a particular person who can track different kinds 
of data can assign to (Assign Reminders to: ) field.
So that the user can start the conversation to the current tenants if they want to extend the term or they want 
to move out or any further actions. That kind of conversation can happen if I am aware about the end date.

So there can be lots of Tenants in the  Propco. For a single agent it's very hard to manage these.
So he will appoint staff's, different different staffs which will handle all kinds of works for himself.
So one staff could go with the propsing or creating the Agreement.
One can for to track all the tenants end date.
Some for the collect the rent.
Some other to manage the repairs.
Some has to do the basic checks like if there is the maintenance checks needs to collected.

So if a person has been assigned to look onto the agreements end dates that can be done towards this section.
Then we can give the reminders or notification to that person where a task can be assigned.

Rent Requests
============
It has a checkbox called Generate Rent Request before the due date.
This is not recommended to use this. Whatever we have the rent date. We can request the rent before that date.

So this is all how here we create the Term. 

Finally to see the term, we need to logout and after login providing UserName and Password.
Then go back through the tools and then to terms. Then it will start reflecting.


Next is the Shared Tenancy
============================
Lead Tenant and Co-Tenant comes under the Shared Tenancy.
*we can create property by using Market Appraisal Form whereas Fast Start is bigger detail Form for the Property for 
the same purpose.

Add the Landlord with the basic details. And the property toward where I have to rent it out.

Create the Applicant by go to MArketing -> Applicant Marketing -> Applicant Card in the menu.
Fill the Applicant details, Name, Title, etc.
This is the form of registering the applicant into the system.
