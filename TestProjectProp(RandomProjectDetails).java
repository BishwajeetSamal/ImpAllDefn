=========================================**********************=========================================
tenancy life-cycle
===================
Generally speaking, the tenant lifecycle involves seven stages: vacancy, screening, leasing, move-in, 
occupancy, ending tenancy, and move-out.
1. Vacancy -> 
------------
Stage one starts with your property being empty. 
It’s critical that you start things off on the right foot and make sure your property is prepared to 
become someone’s new home. To do that, there are some things you should do:
◙ Clean the unit 
◙ Take high-quality photos of the interior and exterior
◙ Handle any necessary repairs and maintenance issues

2. Screening -> 
----------------
During stage two, it’s time to start your screening process.
Once you’ve started marketing your available rental property, it’s time to start scheduling showings 
and considering potential tenants.

Our four-step screening process includes:
◙ Credit check
◙ Criminal background
◙ Income verification (additional layer of protection)
◙ Rental verification 

3. Leasing -> 
--------------
After you’ve screened qualified applicants and selected a tenant, you’ll need to enter 
into a lease agreement.
◙ This includes creating the lease agreement, scheduling a move-in date, calculating move-in costs, and 
having both parties sign the finalized lease agreement.
◙ It’s best practice to have the tenants sign the lease first and make sure both parties receive a copy of 
the signed lease agreement.

4.Move-in ->
-------------
◙ At this point, you should have agreed on a move-in date with your tenant and collected all applicable
 move-in fees before handing over the keys. 
◙ Review any final rules or regulations and create a plan for when and where your tenant will pick up keys 
 to the property.

5.Occupancy ->
--------------
Hopefully, this is the lifecycle step where you’ll spend most of your time.
◙ Once your tenant has moved into your rental property, your focus should shift to property management and
building a strong landlord-tenant relationship. 
                                  ◙  Consider how you will address any issues that arise like late rent 
payments, tenant complaints, lease violations, or emergency maintenance issues. Plan a regular inspection 
schedule (seasonally is a good place to start) and share the schedule with your tenants.

6. Ending tenancy ->
---------------------
◙ Whenever your lease term ends, you and your tenant have the option to either extend the lease or end your
lease agreement.
◙ If your tenant is interested in sticking around, you can either move to a month-to-month agreement or enter
 into a lease renewal with new dates and terms.
◙ If a tenant intends to move, they must provide you with a letter of intent, and if you are ending the 
tenancy, you must send notice to vacate, usually at a set period of time before the lease ends.

7. Move-out ->
---------------
◙ The move-out process is an important step in wrapping up the lifecycle of one tenant before you move 
on to another. 
◙ Like move-in, provide detailed instructions on logistics and timing for move-out dates, cleaning, and 
 handing off keys.

◙ Conduct a move-out inspection to ensure the tenant has complied with all requirements and note any
 maintenance issues that need to be addressed before another tenant can move in. Calculate and return 
 any security deposits promptly.

============================================================================================================
                                        Knowledge Transfer(KT)
                                        ======================
Today Purpose is to understand the lifecycle of the tenancy through TestProject.
Tenancy Term( a written agreement specifying the terms of the rental or temporary possession of a property.)
==============
Duration/Tenancy term/Period of the tenancy of that property. 

So we will proceed with the term. For a agent we do have a diffrent kinds of terms. It could be 3 Months, 2Years , 1 year or we can create for that.
Suppose If I am an Agent and working for the Product and all the terms i can have which an applicant can choose for.

So how we can as a Agent/as a New Agent we  can say, how we can create a term on TestProject.

So to do that we need to Login to the TestProject. Today i am using the QA TestProject with the latest build as 44, this is just for the information.

We are good to go any kind of platform for the TestProject.
For now we are using the desktop Application.

Moving Next, How we create a term.
The access is generally to the admin person or admin staff.
This is crucuial bit where we have to draftout agreement between an applicant and a property.
All the task is done by the administrator.
If i want to do all these then I should have the admin rights with me.

The can only create the term. We create with option called tools.
Tools is kind of Settings in the TestProject Project over here.
Go to TOOLS ->  Data Setup -> Tenancy -> Terms.
-----------------------------------------------
Add New , for that click on Add 
Lets create the duration for the Six Months.
So Six motnth is the duration and rent has to paid monthly.
--------------------
So In our Software, the 1st section is 
Details
======== 
like, *Name: 6Month/Monthly, So here before slash we have duration of the tenancy and after slash pointing to the rent paid in that duration like monthly or Qualterly.
then ,*Description: 6 months is duration and rent needs to paid monthly.
then, *Length: 6 months.
then, *Payment: 1 monthly
then, Laspse To: "Select in Dropdown", means your agreement is about to end and if you want to extends the same agreement
if a tenant have the duration for the 6 months then if he/she  wants to extend the duration for more 6 months
then to do that we have Lapse To field .
then, Apply Tax: "can apply the task" //In india called slabs.
then, a second check box is here (Charge commission on net). //this is for the overall value to what they are paying to and if you want to charge any Agent Commission on it. We can go with this option.
then, Options: Less one day, Invoice for full period, never post after tenancy date, //if i have to pay after 30days then we can pay after 29days (if select the 1st option)
--------------------2nd option (Invoice for full period) -> We can pay for complete Six months or whatever the duration is.
then, Charged In Arr:  Yes or No. //Charged in Arr as in that it should be outstanding as a arrear to the tenant.

Forward Posting Rent
====================
It is here like the pre-payment. Or pay in advance. Paying the rent in advance.
This is generally to allow systems to generate or the rents forward.
Suppose if our tenancy cycle starts with 2nd of April month, Claims is where we start raising the rent from defining rent from one day before.
And Thereafter it will says want to continue till do this time.

Mail Merge
===========
We have agrements printed or we do create the agreements between the tenancy and the landlord. To do that we already
have existing list of agrement letters.
We can select any of the letter from the system and we can add to the process where it has to be  printed.
So first field is 1. Printed at tenancy start (Add or Remove) button.
Once we finished our tenancy that means we have finished confirming our tenancy and then this particular agreement 
will print.
2. Printed at Renewal(Add or Remove) button.
If any tenancy term will get extended then the particular letter will get printed which is to select from 
Initiated Letters where the list of files will be shown.
These are not the uploaded basically but it will give you the list of the Agreement type in the mail merge.
We can create the letters.
Here we do have the letter type. Letter type is like Tenlad Letter(need to confirm) and anathor is the Implement Letter(need to confirm).
If the letter type is Agreement then it start showing in the list (Initiated Letters).

Task List
==========
Task List is generally for the Reminders, Here we can remind to a particular person who can track different kinds 
of data can assign to (Assign Reminders to: ) field.
So that the user can start the conversation to the current tenants if they want to extend the term or they want 
to move out or any further actions. That kind of conversation can happen if I am aware about the end date.

So there can be lots of Tenants in the  TestProject. For a single agent it's very hard to manage these.
So he will appoint staff's, different different staffs which will handle all kinds of works for himself.
So one staff could go with the propsing or creating the Agreement.
One can for to track all the tenants end date.
Some for the collect the rent.
Some other to manage the repairs.
Some has to do the basic checks like if there is the maintenance checks needs to collected.

So if a person has been assigned to look onto the agreements end dates that can be done towards this section.
Then we can give the reminders or notification to that person where a task can be assigned.

Rent Requests
============
It has a checkbox called Generate Rent Request before the due date.
This is not recommended to use this. Whatever we have the rent date. We can request the rent before that date.

So this is all how here we create the Term. 

Finally to see the term, we need to logout and after login providing UserName and Password.
Then go back through the tools and then to terms. Then it will start reflecting.


Next is the Shared Tenancy
============================
Lead Tenant and Co-Tenant comes under the Shared Tenancy.
*we can create property by using Market Appraisal Form whereas Fast Start is bigger detail Form for the Property for 
the same purpose.

Add the Landlord with the basic details. And the property toward where I have to rent it out.

Create the Applicant by go to MArketing -> Applicant Marketing -> Applicant Card in the menu.
Fill the Applicant details, Name, Title, etc.
This is the form of registering the applicant into the system.


==============================Training=====By=====Aekta===============Date:-02/Sep/2022======================
RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
===============================
Java RMI -> Java Remote Method Invocation. 
*It is a API that allows an object to invoke anathor method that exists in seperate address space means In Local Machine or
in Server Machine.      ---------------------------------------
                        | Client | -----(RMI)------> | Server |
                        ---------------------------------------
If client machine try to call or invokes the methods present in Server machine with the help of RMI.
RMI Working -> Two intermediate objects are used for the communication between client and server.

TO work of RMI there are two Intermediate objects for the communication between client and server.
So in Client side the object is used called STUB and in Server side the object used is SKELETION.

=========================================================================================
Normal Java Code On client side
             ↓ 
    |---------------|                               
    | Remote        |   
    | method call   |
    |on client      |
    |---------------|
            ↓  " Parameters can send from here an this is optional"
      -------------
      |Stub Object|
      -------------
            ↓  "Connection can be the internet or any other communication way"    
    -----------------
    |Skeleton Object|
    -----------------
            ↓   "Take parameters and sends back the response."
    |---------------|                               
    | Remote        |   
    | method call   |
    |on server      |
    |---------------|
             ↓ 
Normal Java Code on Server Side

===========================================================================================
STUB Object -> It creates a information block and sends to the server.
This information block consists of "ID of Remote object (i.e. which to call)", "method name to invoke", "which parameter to pass"

SKELETION Object -> It passes the request from STUB Object to the Remote Object.
*It calls the desired method.
*Forwards the parameter receives from Client side.
*Sends the response to the Stub Object.

Goals of RMI
------------
1. Minimizes complexity of the Application.
2.Distributed Garbage collection.
3.Minimizes difference between working with local and remote objects.
 
RMI Registry
------------
It is a namespace on which all server objects are placed. 
    Client Invokes the method using fetched objects.
    Client fetches the object using lookup() method at very first time before to server.
    Whenever server gives according to the client request then that method get placd inside the RMI Registry with
    the help of bind() and rebind() method. Binds are the objects of RMI Registry. 

                                              KT Session
                                            ==============
We have some 5 Entities, Named -> Agent, Applicant, Contractors, Landlords, Properties, Tenant.

For Example -> Select any Entity and click on Search Icon and we will get all the list.
After hit on Search icon Landlord list will comeup from the TestProject DB.

After click on any landlord we will see the details regarding the landlord.

1.So Landlord is an Entity and there are many aspects related to it and you can get it from Left side of the page under Navigator.
Like :-> Address Details, Banking, Notes, CRN/FICO Details, Data Processing Preferences, Letter Audit, Power Of Attorney,
Building Property Insurance, Contents Insurance, Payments Breakdown, Preffered Suppliers, Statement Copies, Accountant/Invoice,
Fees Disbursement, Associated Contacts, Properties Owned, Clauses, Tasks, Document Mgmt, E-Signature, Webforms, etc...

Many fields are involved to the respective aspects.
These aspects are used by the Agent in the UK. 

2.For Property Entity also show many List of Properties, It has also respective Tabs under the Navigator.

In Database, TestProject has 2 db 1.qadb and 2. local

All entity have there own seperated table. Like Property have seperate table and landlord have seperate table and all these 
tables contains a huge data or table.

3.In TestProject-demo -> we have "properties" table . Suppose there will a requirement come to add the column then we need to add,
then we need to break into  do anathor table called "properties_ext" Need to add into the "properties_ext".

4.Similarly, there is a table for the Landlord called "landlords". Again it has the "landlords_ext" also and it contains the 
columns related to it.

5. On Search the Contractor, it has the table called "tbl_cons".

We have anathor database, "TestProjectsystem-v1-v2". There are certain tables in it which have a configurations sort of data.
Like a table called, "netloc" table has the domain name and the required path for that domain name. Like in that domain 
for image what is the path, so here are the configurations based data available here.

*One Applicant Entity is also there but you will get all the data of the applicant inside the table "tenants".
---------------------------------
Suppose A person come to the agent that the Person want a property, so that time the person is the Applicant.
Then that agent says Okay, we have a property you can rent it out. 
Then Agent will Register for the Property and then the Agent will inform to Applicant that when it will be available.
Thenafter Agent call to the Applicant and says that the propery you are requesting we had talked with the Landlord and 
you can rent it from that day.
So its fine to do the legal formalities that is required. Then the person will get converted to the Tenant.

So very first time the person went to the  Agent for the property, so agent will do the registration as a Tenant.
To do that, Go to toolbar, where Find/New -> Applicant -> Edit/New, this is from where Agent will create the Applicant.

In the Db, for the Applicant and the Tenant is the same table. In Market Appraisal Form, where we will create a new Landlord
or the Property and various things.

------------------------------------------
Now Search for the code where and to interact with UI/Code. 
Go to Project and Serch By Ctrl+Shift+R and enter "PropertyNavigator"
So the PropertyNavigator class, All the Tabs on left side of the Page under the Navigator like Property Info, PropertyDetails,
Rent, Description etc.. are available.

The same kind of the structure for others aswell. Like for Landlord it has "LandlordNavigator".
For Contractor, "ContractorNavigaotor" is present.
For Tenant, "TenantNavigator" is present.

-----------
So For Example, lets take PropertyNavigator class, Use Ctrl+O For createNewComp(Enum<?>)


Note:- createNewComp(Enum<?>) will be available for PropertyNavigator or TenantNavigator or LandlordNavigator etc.

Basically createNewComp is a component, This method actually creates the classes.
Every Class is representing to the seperate Tab.
It has switch case, like
    case navbarPropHome:                return new PropertyHome(getWorkspace(),SWT.NONE,this);
    case navbarPropGeoData:             return new GeographicalData(getWorkspace(),SWT.NONE,this);

        etc....

In Tab it is Home, Under this Tab, all fields are present, TestProject Id:, Reference, Address, Street, Town etc.
All fields details are encapsulated in a java file i.e. PropertyHome(getWorkspace(),SWT.NONE,this);
Subsequently we have further below tabs related to their functions 

**All the switch case: Names represents the Enum in public enum NavBarTestProjectmp{
    navbarPropHome("Home");   
    navbarPropGeoData("Geographical Data"); etc...
}

navbarPropGeoData is All fields under the Tab "Property Info". 
In field Dropdown is called Combo in SWT.

All are defined in the class defination. We can find the fields name according searching in the class.

**We need to deal with the "TestProject-enterprise-client" //is for the frontend fro the desktop application
 and "TestProject-enterprise-ejb". //is for the backend.

 All the data shown in fileds are fetched via the DB and that operations done under the server code present in "TestProject-enterprise-ejb".
 Our TestProject Desktop Application and the Server code get interacted via a technology called "RMI (Remote Method Invocation)".

 *****A class is here called "TestProjectSessionBean.java" -> This class is that Api/server side class that is responsible for the request
 accepted from the client side.

 Now whatever the request goes through the client side that get landed to the class called "TestProjectSessionBean".

 *Note:-> When we click on Left side pane where we click on particular tab or Property, the data get populated in the field i.e request
 goes from client and goes to the server. To know the request from the client Go to PropertyNavigator, in clientside the call is written 
 that call  search for "loadPropertyData()" for Property, "loadTenantData()" for Tenant, "loadLandlordData()" for Landlord etc..

 in loadPropertyData() -> there will a code by wihich we can know it is making the call to the server.
 propertyDataVO = (PropertyDataVO) EJBHelper.callEjbThrows(shell,MethodNames.getPropertyDataVO, TestProjectUserView.getInstance().getLoginDetails(), TestProjectUtil.checkNull(id));

 MethodNames in above Line is the Enum.
 public enum MethodNames{ 
    getPostingNotes("getting posting notes"),  //these are the method names
    getBalanceSheetData("getting balance sheet data"), //these are the method names
    makeAccountTransfer("posting transfer transaction"), etc.. //these are the method names
 }
//And these are the methods present in Server side.

So need to check for the method called getPropertyDataVO mentioned above and seach in the "PropertySessionBean.java" which is present inside the 
"TestProject-enterprise-ejb".

In server "TestProject-enterprise-ejb" side,
we get the method then,
public PropertyDataVO getPropertyDataVO(LoginDetails domain, String strPropertyID) throws RemoteException{
    return PropertyDataDAO.getCoreData(domain,strPropertyID); 
}

getCoreData() is a method 
------------------------------------------start-------------------------------------------------------------------
public static PropertyDataVO getCoreData(LoginDetails domainName,String strPropertyID) throws RemoteException
    {
        SQLQueries cn=new SQLQueries(domainName);
        try {
            PropertyDataVO propertyDataVO = setup(cn,strPropertyID); //setup here where we get the related query
            if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(strPropertyID)) {
                getPropertyHmoLicenses(cn, Long.valueOf(strPropertyID), propertyDataVO);
                populateOffersAndApplicationTabsUrls(cn, Long.valueOf(strPropertyID), propertyDataVO);
            }
            return propertyDataVO;
        } catch (SQLException sqle) {
            logger.error("Error occured while getting coreData against propertyId:"+strPropertyID,sqle);
            throw new RemoteException(sqle.toString());
        }
        finally{
            cn.closeAll();
        }
    }
------------------------------------end-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Code you will get in PropertyDataDao.java, Same for Tenant, TenantDataDao.java // which is in Server side code

For the  Query we have the QueryBuilder, 
like ResultSet rs = cn.getQueryResultThrows("select"+strFields+"from properties LEFT OUTER JOIN property_ext on properties.property_id = property_ext.property .....");
--------------------------------start---------------------------------------------------
public ResultSet getQueryResultThrows(String queryToPerform) throws SQLException {
        closeResults();
           System.out.println(prompt()+" query>>'" + queryTruncated(queryToPerform)+"'");
        
        if (!checkConnection(true/* , maxSlaveTime */) )
            return null;
       
        final Statement stmt = createStatement(true);
        
        if(logger.isDebugEnabled()){
            
        
            String message = prompt(stmt)+" query>>'" + queryTruncated(queryToPerform)+"'";
   
            //ALWAYS OUTPUT TO DEBUG LOG
            logger.debug(message);
        }
        
        stmt.executeQuery(queryToPerform);
        return stmt.getResultSet();
    }
-------------------------------end-------------------------------------

then after fetch all the data from the table,
put inside the
rsMetaData = rs.getMetaData(); //this is present in the ResultSet.class , This basically retrives the number, types and properties of this ResultSet object's
//columns. 

Then all the data get set into the respective column to send back to the client as a response like,

data.getProperty_id().setColumnName(rsMetaData.getColumnName(1));
        data.getProperty_id().setColumnType(DataTypeConstants.TYPE_ALPHA);
        data.getProperty_id().setColumnLength(rsMetaData.getPrecision(1));


        data.getRef().setColumnName(rsMetaData.getColumnName(2));
        data.getRef().setColumnType(DataTypeConstants.TYPE_ALPHA);
        data.getRef().setColumnLength(rsMetaData.getPrecision(2));   etc....


So Finally the data send back to the client in the form of response, and the object is PropertyDataVO.

The RMI protocol makes use of two other protocols for its on-the-wire format: Java Object Serialization and HTTP.
The Object Serialization protocol is used to marshal call and return data.
Same for Property is "PropertyDataVO", for Tenant is "TenantDataVO", for LandLord is "LandLordDataVO" etc. Here VO is the Suffix.

So Structure of PropertyDataVO -> In this class all the fields will present
You will not get the exact name of Column of DB in Java Class
All the fileds are of type "TableFieldVO". It has some properties, are columnName, value, columnLength, tableName.
 and all the fields data are set and finally "return data";

 Then the return data get transfered to the "TestProject-enterprise-client" in "PropertyNavigator.java" in "loadPropertyData" method.

Thus, we have two approaches, One is XML Approach, and second is VO Approach.
XML Approach is the old One. It's a legecy code and used majorly in this application.
We don't need to follow it. It just to know for the update any feature in future.



Important
-----------------
What Is a JavaBean?
*******************
A JavaBean is mostly like a POJO, with some strict set of rules on how to implement it. 
The rules specify that it should be serializable, have a null constructor, and allow access to variables using methods that 
follow the getX() and setX() convention.

 POJO as a JavaBean?
********************
Since a JavaBean is essentially a POJO, let's convert EmployeePOJO to a JavaBean by implementing the necessary bean rules:
public class EmployeeBean implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -3760445487636086034L;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private LocalDate startDate;

    public EmployeeBean() {
    }

    public EmployeeBean(String firstName, String lastName, LocalDate startDate) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.startDate = startDate;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    // additional getters and setters
}


Here, in order to convert the POJO into a JavaBean, we've implemented the Serializable interface, marked properties as
private, and used getter/setter methods to access the properties.


DTO
***
A DTO, also referred to as Data Transfer Object, encapsulates values to carry data between processes or networks.
This helps in reducing the number of methods called.
By including multiple parameters or values in a single call, we reduce the network overhead in remote operations.
A DTO does not have any explicit behavior. It basically helps in making the code loosely coupled by decoupling the domain
 models from the presentation layer.

DTOs have flat structures without any business logic.

VO
**
A VO should always override the equals() and hashCode() methods.
VO, also known as the Value Object, is a special type of object that can hold values such as java.lang.Integer and java.lang.Long.
It's a good practice to make Value Objects immutable.
 The change in values occurs only by creating a new object and not by updating values in the old object itself.
-----------------
===============================================================================================================================
Now XML Approach
-----------------
Suppose Address I am trying to change in Property Info.
After Save it is showing the validation problem due to some reason.
Error Like:-> "Your total Landlord rent assignment must equal 100%."

* In Every ...Navigator Class like PropertyNavigator, TenantNavigator or LandlordNavigator, here we have a method called 
createXMLForNewEntry() and other is createXMLForExistingEntry(boolean). 

createXMLForExistingEntry() //We can get in all ...Navigator file.
============================
This method will create an XML. using final MakeXML mx = new MakeXML();
Suppose we have changed in many different-different tab and now we are going to save it.
Now we need to pack all these and need to send to the server.

mx.createXML(hashProperties,"UpdateProperty",hashWhere,XMLConstants.UPDATE);
"hashProperties" is the HashMap, "UpdateProperty" is the method name, XMLConstants are Enum type like Insert, Update, Delete. 




=***************************************JB=*************************************************************
enterprise bean class is HelperBean.java

Helper classes
----------------
**The EJB stands for Enterprise Java beans
*EJB is conceptually based on the Java RMI(Remote Method Invocation) specification
Helper classes are classes that the primary bean class calls upon to successfully
execute its business methods.

EJB
===
EJB stands for Enterprise Java Bean.
EJB is an essential part of j2ee platform.
EJB provides an architechture to devlop and deploy component based enterprise applications considering robustness, high scalability,
and high performance.

When to use EJB ?
=================
Application needs Remote Access. In other words, it is distributed.
Application needs to be scalable, EJB supports load balancing, clustering and fail-over.
Application needs encapsulated business logic, EJB application is seperated from presentation and persistent layer.

Types Of EJBs
=============
Enterprise Beans -> Session Beans -> State less and Stateful
Enterprise Beans -> Message Beans
Enterprise Beans -> Entity Beans -> Bean Managed Persistence

Enterprise Beans -> Entity Beans -> Container Managed Persistence

Session Bean
-------------
Session bean stores data of a  particular user for a single session. It can be stateful or stateless.
It is less resource intensive as compared to the entity bean.
Session bean gets destroyed as soon as user session terminates.

Stateless Session bean is a business object that represents business logic only. It doesn't have state(data).
In other words, conversational state between multiple method calls is not maintained by the container incase of stateless 
session bean.

The stateless bean objects are pooled by the EJB container to service the request on demand.
It can be accessed by one client at a time. Incase of concurrent access, EJB container routes each request to different instance.

Annotations used in Stateless Session Bean.

Entity Bean
-----------
Entity Beans represent persistent data storage.
User data can be saved to database via entity beans and later on can be retrieved form the database in the entity bean.

Message Driven Beans
---------------------
Message driven beans are used in context of JMS(Java Message Service). Message driven beans can consume JMS messages for external
entities and act accordingly.
