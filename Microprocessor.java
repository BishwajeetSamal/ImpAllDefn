									Introduction to Processors
									==========================
Wherever programming is involved then we need the microprocessor or microcontroller.

**The 8085 Microprocessor is a popular Microprocessor used in Industries for various applications. 
Such as traffic light control, temperature control, stepper motor control, etc.

In order to get each next time phases of traffic flow, we use Linear Regression (LR) algorithm as ML algorithm.
It is used in washing machines, microwave ovens, mobile phones, etc.

8085 and onwards were initally commercial successful processor.
