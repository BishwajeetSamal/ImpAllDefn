												JIRA
												====
--> Jira is a proprietary issue tracking product developed by Atlassian that allows bug tracking, agile, project 
management and Work management.

--> Jira Software is part of a family of products designed to help teams of all types manage work.
Originally, Jira was designed as a bug and issue tracker. But today, Jira has evolved into a powerful work
management tool for all kinds of use cases, from requirements and test case management to agile software development.

*Jira just offers you a list of 5 (Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor and Trival) priority names to manage 
prioritisation of your bugs or incidents. 
*Blocker would be the highest level of priority and trivial would be the lowest. The others rank in between.

What is a sprint? 
------------------
-> A sprint is a fixed time period where teams complete work from their product backlog. 
-> Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long
-> At the end of the sprint, a team will typically have built and implemented a working product increment.

Story in jira
-------------
-> Stories, also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of 
an end user
-> Epics are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).

What is a PI in planning?
-------------------------
*PI Planning stands for Program Increment Planning.
*PI Planning sessions are regularly scheduled events held throughout the year where multiple teams within
the same Agile Release Train (ART) meet to align to a shared vision, discuss features, plan the roadmap, and
identify cross-team dependencies.

What is UAT ?
--------------
*User acceptance testing (UAT), also called application testing or end-user testing, is a phase of software 
development in which the software is tested in the real world by its intended audience.

Development -> Testing -> UAT -> Production

The goal of UAT is to make sure the software, website or application can handle all required 
tasks in real-world scenarios, according to user specifications. This type of UAT process is often called beta
 testing (see more below).

UAT is performed by –

1.>Client
2.>End users
