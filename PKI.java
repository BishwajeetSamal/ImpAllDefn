														PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
														===============================

* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) refers to the setup that enables the secure exchange of information over the network 
using public-key encryption.

* This setup relies on trust that is built between the parties involved in the communication.

* This trust is based on digital certificates issued by a neutral and trusted authority known as a Certificate Authority (CA).

 PKI Support in Java
 -------------------
Java platform has APIs to facilitate the creation, storage, and validation of digital certificates:

KeyStore: Java provides the KeyStore class for persistent storage of cryptographic keys and trusted certificates. 
Here, KeyStore can represent both key-store and trust-store files. These files have similar content but vary in their usage.
CertStore: Additionally, Java has the CertStore class, which represents a public repository of potentially untrusted 
certificates and revocation lists. We need to retrieve certificates and revocation lists for certificate path building amongst other 
usages.
Java has a built-in trust-store called “cacerts” that contains certificates for well known CAs.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Implementation Using Java 8 - Use Case
======================================================================

Background:
-----------
A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework that manages digital keys and certificates.

It provides the foundation for secure communication and authentication in various applications, such 
as online banking, e-commerce, and secure email.

Java 8, being a widely used programming language, can be used to implement PKI-based security solutions.

Use Case: Secure Online Banking Application
-------------------------------------------
Scenario:
---------
A financial institution wants to enhance the security of their online banking application by implementing a 
PKI-based authentication and communication system using Java 8.

Implementation Steps:
---------------------
Generate Key Pair:
------------------
Using Java's KeyPairGenerator class, generate a key pair (public key and private key) for each user during the registration process.


Create X.509 Certificates:
--------------------------
Utilize Java X509Certificate class to generate X.509 certificates for each user's public key. These certificates will 
be issued by the bank's Certificate Authority (CA).


Certificate Distribution:
-------------------------
The CA public key certificate needs to be pre-installed in the application to enable trust in the CA's signatures.
During registration, the user's certificate is issued and provided to the user securely.

Secure Communication:
---------------------
When a user logs in, the server presents its own X.509 certificate.
The client verifies the server certificate against its list of trusted CAs to ensure the server's authenticity.
Establish a secure communication channel using Java's SSLContext and SSLSocketFactory.

Client Authentication:
----------------------
Upon user login, the client sends its certificate to the server.
The server verifies the client's certificate against its list of trusted CAs to authenticate the client.

Data Encryption and Decryption:
-------------------------------
Utilize the server's public key to encrypt sensitive data sent from the client.
The server can decrypt the data using its private key.
Similarly, the client can encrypt data for the server's consumption.

Revocation Checking:
--------------------
Implement a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) mechanism to check the validity 
of certificates.
Java's CertPathValidator class can be used to verify certificate revocation status.

Benefits:
---------
Enhanced Security: PKI-based authentication ensures a high level of security, as it's based on cryptographic keys and certificates.
Data Privacy: Encrypted communication ensures that sensitive information is transmitted securely.
Trust Model: PKI establishes a trust model, making it difficult for malicious entities to impersonate legitimate users or services.

Challenges:
-----------
Complexity: PKI implementation involves various components like key generation, certificate management, and revocation 
checks, which can be complex.
Maintenance: Managing certificates and ensuring their validity requires ongoing effort.

Conclusion:
-----------
Implementing a PKI-based solution using Java 8 in the context of a secure online banking application enhances 
security, ensures encrypted communication, and establishes a trust framework between clients and servers. However, it's 
essential to consider the complexity and maintenance aspects of such an implementation.



I want the working model of PKI Certificate. Illustrate with diagram
=====================================================================
 I can describe a working model of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) using PKI certificates and provide a textual 
 representation of the architecture.

 Working Model of PKI Certificate:
 ---------------------------------

 1. Entities:
 Certificate Authority (CA): A trusted organization that issues digital certificates. It verifies the identity of certificate 
 holders and signs their certificates.

End User: An individual or entity that requires secure communication or authentication through the use of certificates.

Application Server: A server that provides a service requiring secure communication.

2. Architecture:
----------------
Step 1: Certificate Generation and Issuance:
--------------------------------------------

The End User generates a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is kept secret, while 
the public key is shared with others.
The End User's public key is submitted to the CA along with identity information for verification.

The CA verifies the End User's identity and generates a digital certificate containing the End User's public key and 
identity information. The CA signs the certificate with its private key, creating a digital signature.

Step 2: Certificate Distribution and Verification:
---------------------------------------------------
The CA's public key is widely distributed and embedded in trusted applications, browsers, and devices.

When the Application Server starts a secure session, it sends its digital certificate to the client along with its public key.
The client verifies the authenticity of the Application Server's certificate by checking the digital signature 
against the CA public key.
If the signature is valid and the certificate hasn't been revoked, the client trusts the server's identity.

Step 3: Secure Communication:
-----------------------------
8. The client generates a random symmetric encryption key for the session. It encrypts this key using the server's 
public key and sends it to the server.

The server uses its private key to decrypt the symmetric encryption key.
The client and server use the symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt their communication, ensuring confidentiality.

Step 4: Digital Signatures and Authentication:
----------------------------------------------
11. If the client needs to authenticate, it generates a message hash and signs it with its private key, creating a digital signature.

The server verifies the signature using the client's public key. If the signature is valid, the server trusts the client's identity.


Step 5: Revocation and Renewal:
-------------------------------
Certificates have an expiration date. Before expiration, the End User renews the certificate by going through 
the verification process again.

If a certificate is compromised or no longer valid, the CA revokes the certificate and publishes a Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

Please note that this textual representation simplifies the processes involved in PKI certificate management and secure 
communication. Real-world PKI implementations require careful configuration, proper handling of certificates, and 
adherence to security best practices.




The End User generates a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. 
The private key is kept secret, while the public key is shared with others.


WHo is this ? Browser or the server here
=============================================================================


In the context of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the "End User" refers to an individual or entity that requires 
secure communication or authentication. The term "End User" typically represents the person or system that is utilizing 
the PKI certificates for secure transactions or interactions.

In your question, when it's mentioned that "The End User generates a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key," 
it refers to the action taken by the individual or entity using the PKI certificates. This process generally involves the 
following steps:

The End User generates a key pair (consisting of a public key and a private key) on their own device or system.
The private key is kept securely on the user's device and is not shared.
The public key is shared with others or made available for anyone who needs to communicate with or verify the identity of the End User.
This action is typically performed by software running on the End Users device, and it can be done using various tools 
or libraries that support key pair generation, such as OpenSSL, Java's KeyPairGenerator, or other cryptographic libraries.

The "End User" could refer to an individual using a web browser, an application connecting to a server, or any entity 
that interacts within a PKI-secured environment. The exact roles can vary based on the context of the PKI deployment.



like I am requesting google.com from my system called dell. So now tell me the End user ?
==========================================================================================
In the context you've described, if you are requesting the website "google.com" from your system named "dell," then the 
following roles can be identified:

End User: You, as the person using the system (in this case, your "dell" computer), are the end user. You are using a 
web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to request the website.

Client (Web Browser): The web browser running on your system ("dell") acts as the client. It sends a request to access 
the website "google.com."

Server: Google's web servers, hosting the website "google.com," act as the server. They receive your request, process it, 
and send back the web page content to your web browser.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificates: PKI certificates are used by both the client (your web browser) and the 
server (Google's web servers) to establish secure communication. Your web browser uses PKI certificates to verify the 
authenticity of the website, while Google's web servers use PKI certificates to secure the communication with your browser.

So, in this scenario, you are the end user, your "dell" system is the client (web browser), and Google's web servers are 
the server. PKI certificates play a role in securing the communication between your browser and the server.



So first of all who is sharing what. Who is sharing the PKI certificate and how ?
=================================================================================
In the context of your interaction with a website like "google.com," the sharing of PKI certificates occurs in the following way:

Website (Server) Shares PKI Certificate:
-----------------------------------------
When you visit a website like "google.com," the website's server presents its PKI certificate to your web browser. 
This certificate includes the website public key, information about the website's identity (such as its domain name), and 
is digitally signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify its authenticity.

Certificate Authority (CA) Shares Public Key:
---------------------------------------------
The CA's public key, which is used to verify the authenticity of certificates, is already distributed and embedded in 
widely used browsers and devices. Browsers come pre-installed with a list of trusted CAs and their public keys.

Browser (Client) Verification:
-----------------------------
Your web browser checks the website PKI certificate against its list of trusted CAs. If the certificate is issued by a 
trusted CA and has not expired or been revoked, the browser considers the website's identity as verified and trusted.

Secure Communication Setup:
---------------------------
Once the PKI certificate is verified, your browser and the website server use the certificate's public key to set up 
a secure communication channel using encryption (typically using SSL/TLS protocols). This ensures that data exchanged 
between your browser and the server is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.

In summary, the website server shares its PKI certificate with your web browser when you visit the site. 
Your browser then uses the CA public key, which is already embedded in the browser, to verify the certificate's 
authenticity. This process establishes a secure communication channel between your browser and the website's 
server, allowing for encrypted and trusted data exchange.



So on a daily basis chrome or firefox will get updated for all new CA certificate.
==================================================================================
Yes, that's correct. Web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and other major browsers regularly update their lists 
of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and their public keys. These updates ensure that the browser can 
effectively verify the authenticity of websites' PKI certificates and establish secure communication.

Here's how this process typically works:

Regular Updates: Browser developers maintain a list of trusted CAs and their public keys, known as the "root store." 
This list is periodically updated to include new CAs or revoke trust from compromised or untrusted CAs.

Browser Updates: When you update your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), you're not only getting new features and bug 
fixes but also updates to the list of trusted CAs. These updates are crucial to maintaining a secure browsing experience.

New CAs: As new CAs are established and gain recognition as trustworthy entities, browser updates include their public 
keys in the root store. This allows your browser to recognize certificates issued by these CAs as legitimate.

Revocations: If a CA's practices are compromised or it is found to be untrustworthy, browser updates may revoke trust 
from that CA's public key. This prevents certificates issued by that CA from being trusted, even if they were issued 
before the revocation.

Expired Certificates: Browser updates also handle the removal of expired certificates from the root store.

Certificate Transparency: Some browsers also support Certificate Transparency (CT), a mechanism that helps detect 
misissued certificates. CT requires CAs to publicly log issued certificates, which browsers can monitor to ensure transparency.

Online Revocation Checking: In addition to relying solely on pre-installed lists, browsers may also support 
mechanisms like Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Online Certificate Status Checker (OCSP stapling) to 
check the real-time status of certificates.

It's essential to keep your browser up to date to ensure it has the latest list of trusted CAs and to benefit from 
improved security measures. This way, your browser can effectively verify the authenticity of websites and maintain a 
secure browsing environment.





In a typical scenario, the server provides its PKI certificate during the SSL/TLS handshake process when a client 
(such as a web browser) initiates a secure connection. 
Here's a breakdown of how the server provides its PKI certificate:

Client Request to Server:
-------------------------
When a client (e.g., web browser) wants to establish a secure connection to a server (e.g., Spring Boot application), it 
sends a request to the server.

Server Response with Certificate:
---------------------------------
The server responds to the client's request by presenting its PKI certificate. The certificate is sent as part of the 
SSL/TLS handshake process.

SSL/TLS Handshake:
------------------
The SSL/TLS handshake is a process where the client and server exchange information and negotiate the terms of the secure connection. 
During this process, the server provides its PKI certificate to the client

Certificate Verification:
------------------------
The clients web browser verifies the authenticity of the servers certificate using the public key of the certificates issuer 
(typically a trusted Certificate Authority). The browser checks if the certificate is properly signed and whether it's 
valid and not expired.

Establishment of Secure Connection:
-----------------------------------
Once the certificate is verified, the client and server proceed to establish a secure encrypted connection. 
This encrypted connection is used to securely exchange data between the client and server.

Here's a conceptual representation of how the server provides its PKI certificate during the SSL/TLS handshake:

Client            Server
  |                 |
  |----- Request ---->|
  |                 |
  |<---- Response ----|
  |                 |
  |<--- Certificate --| (Server provides PKI certificate)
  |                 |
  |--- Certificate -->| (Client verifies certificate)
  |                 |
  |<---- Finished ----|
  |                 |
  |---- Finished ---->|
  |                 |
  |<-- Encrypted Data -| (Secure communication begins)
  |                 |

In the Spring Boot application example, the server's PKI certificate is presented as part of the SSL/TLS 
handshake process when a client (e.g., web browser) makes a secure connection to the server. 

The certificate is then verified by the client's browser to ensure the authenticity of the server, and the secure communication channel 
is established for further data exchange.

PKI certificate is free or paid one 
===================================
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates can be both free and paid, depending on the type of certificate and the 
certificate authority (CA) issuing it.

name some opensource PKI certificate that I can use for free
============================================================
Here are some open-source PKI certificate solutions that you can use for free:

certificates and identities within an organization's network.

ETC...



use OpenSSL to the sSpringboot where use server as google.com and client as chrome and illustrate the code and explain the scenario
====================================================================================================================================
Using OpenSSL to set up an SSL/TLS connection between a Spring Boot server (representing "google.com") and a client 
(representing Chrome) involves several steps. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes and 
doesn't cover all the intricacies of real-world SSL/TLS configurations.

Server-Side (Spring Boot) Code:
-------------------------------

Generate a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL:
--------------------------------------------------
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server-key.pem -out server-cert.pem -days 365

Create a Spring Boot application with a controller that serves as the "server."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application.properties:

server.port=8443
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:server-cert.pem
server.ssl.key-store-password=your_keystore_password
server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12


SecureController.java:

@RestController
public class SecureController {

    @GetMapping("/secure")
    public String secureEndpoint() {
        return "This is a secure endpoint!";
    }
}

Client-Side (Chrome) Interaction:
---------------------------------
Open Chrome and navigate to https://localhost:8443/secure. You might encounter a security warning due to the self-signed certificate.

To proceed, click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)."

Chrome establishes a secure connection to the Spring Boot server using the self-signed certificate

Explanation of the Scenario:
----------------------------

You have generated a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL. This certificate acts as the server's identity for the 
Spring Boot application.

The Spring Boot server is configured to use the self-signed certificate for secure communication on port 8443.

When you access https://localhost:8443/secure in Chrome, the browser recognizes that the certificate is self-signed and 
issues a security warning.

You bypass the security warning by proceeding to the site. Chrome establishes a secure connection to the server using 
the self-signed certificate.

The Spring Boot server responds to the request from Chrome with the "This is a secure endpoint!" message.

The interaction demonstrates how SSL/TLS works to secure communication between a server and a client (browser). 
In a real-world scenario, websites use certificates signed by trusted Certificate Authorities to avoid security warnings.

Please note that using self-signed certificates is not recommended for production use, as they do not provide the same 
level of trust and security as certificates issued by trusted CAs. In a real-world scenario, you would obtain a 
certificate from a trusted CA to avoid security warnings and ensure secure communication.

How in browser will show the secure icon on using secure OpenSSL
-----------------------------------------------------------------
When you set up a secure connection using SSL/TLS (such as OpenSSL) and visit a website in a web browser, the 
browser will display a secure icon to indicate that the connection is secure and encrypted. The specific 
appearance of the secure icon can vary slightly between different web browsers, but it generally looks like a 
padlock icon. Here's how it works:

Connection Establishment:
When you access a website using "https://" (secure HTTP), the browser initiates a secure connection using SSL/TLS protocols.

Server Certificate Verification:
The server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the browser. The browser checks the certificate's validity, authenticity, and 
issuer against its list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).


Encryption and Secure Communication:
Once the certificate is verified, the browser and the server exchange encryption keys and establish a secure 
communication channel. All data transmitted between the browser and the server is encrypted.

Secure Icon Display:
If the server's certificate is valid and verified, the browser displays a secure icon to indicate that the connection is secure. 
This icon is typically a padlock icon that can appear in the address bar, near the URL of the website.

Additional Indicators:
Some browsers also provide additional indicators when you click on the padlock icon. 
You might see information about the website's certificate, connection details, and more.

Here's how the secure icon might look in different web browsers:

Google Chrome: A padlock icon appears in the address bar, and if you click on it, you'll see more details about the 
certificate and connection.

Mozilla Firefox: A padlock icon appears in the address bar, and if you click on it, you'll see information about the websites 
connection security.

Microsoft Edge: Similar to Chrome and Firefox, Edge displays a padlock icon in the address bar for secure connections.

The presence of the secure icon indicates that the website's connection is encrypted and that the servers 
certificate is valid and verified by a trusted CA. This helps users recognize that they are interacting with a 
secure and legitimate website.



What PKI certificate helps on. Like what benifits of using it.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates offer several benefits that contribute to enhanced security, trust, and 
communication in digital environments. Here are some key benefits of using PKI certificates:

Authentication:
PKI certificates provide a robust way to authenticate the identity of individuals, servers, and devices. Certificates are 
issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) after verifying the identity of the entity. This helps prevent unauthorized
 access and impersonation.


Data Encryption:
PKI certificates enable encryption of sensitive data during transmission. This ensures that even if intercepted, the data 
remains unintelligible to unauthorized parties.

Data Integrity:
PKI certificates help maintain the integrity of data by ensuring that it has not been tampered with during transmission. 
Any alterations to the data would invalidate the digital signature associated with the certificate.

Non-Repudiation:
PKI certificates provide non-repudiation, meaning that a sender cannot deny sending a message, and a receiver cannot deny 
receiving it. This is achieved through the use of digital signatures.

Secure Communication:
PKI certificates establish secure communication channels between parties, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Authorization and Access Control:
PKI certificates can be used to control access to resources by verifying the identity and permissions of users and devices.

Trusted Third-Party Verification:
Certificates issued by well-known CAs are trusted by default in browsers and other software. This trust facilitates secure 
online interactions without users having to manually verify each certificate.

Certificate Revocation:
PKI certificates support mechanisms for revoking certificates in case they are compromised or no longer valid. This helps 
prevent the use of outdated or compromised certificates.

Compliance and Regulations:
PKI certificates play a crucial role in meeting compliance standards and regulations in various industries, such as 
financial services, healthcare, and e-commerce.

Client Authentication:
PKI certificates can be used for client authentication, enabling secure access to systems, applications, and services.

Email Security:
PKI certificates can be used to digitally sign and encrypt email communications, ensuring their authenticity and confidentiality.

Code Signing:
Developers use PKI certificates to sign software code, ensuring its integrity and authenticity. This is important 
for distributing software without triggering security alerts.

Document Signing:
PKI certificates enable the digital signing of documents, contracts, and agreements, providing a legally valid and 
tamper-evident signature.

In essence, PKI certificates create a foundation of trust and security in digital communication, transactions, and 
interactions. They are a fundamental component in safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining privacy, and 
enabling secure digital operations across various industries.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
**PKI certificates work at the transport layer, providing security for communication over a network. 
* They are typically used to secure connections between clients (such as web browsers or API clients) and servers. 
The DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC is part of the application layer and manages incoming HTTP requests and their 
corresponding handlers.

*Here's how PKI certificates are used in the context of a Spring MVC application:
Client-Server Communication:
PKI certificates secure the communication channel between clients (e.g., web browsers or API clients) and servers 
(e.g., Spring Boot application). The communication can be HTTP or HTTPS.

*SSL/TLS Handshake:
When a client connects to a server over HTTPS (secure HTTP), an SSL/TLS handshake process occurs. 
During this process, the server presents its PKI certificate to the client.

Certificate Verification:
The client verifies the server's certificate to ensure its authenticity and validity. The client checks if the 
certificate is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and is not expired or revoked.

Encryption and Decryption:
Once the certificate is verified, the client and server establish an encrypted communication channel. Data exchanged 
between them is encrypted using the public key from the server's certificate (used for encryption) and decrypted 
using the server's private key.

DispatcherServlet and Handlers:
The DispatcherServlet in a Spring MVC application receives incoming HTTP requests. It determines which controller 
handler should handle the request based on the request's URL. The DispatcherServlet is not directly involved in 
the SSL/TLS handshake or certificate verification process.






Certainly, let's walk through the step-by-step process of how a client (such as a web browser) requests a page from a Spring 
Boot server over HTTPS. We'll cover the communication process, including how the SSL/TLS handshake, certificate 
verification, and API calling are carried out.

Assumptions:
------------
The client is a web browser (Chrome).
The server is a Spring Boot application.
The communication is over HTTPS.
1. Client Initiates a Request:

The user enters a URL (e.g., https://your-server.com/page) in the web browser's address bar and presses Enter.
The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server.
2. SSL/TLS Handshake:

The server responds with a message indicating that it requires a secure connection.
The browser initiates the SSL/TLS handshake process to establish a secure connection.
3. Server Presents Certificate:

The server presents its SSL/TLS certificate (public key) to the browser.
The certificate contains information about the server's identity and public key.
4. Certificate Verification:

The browser verifies the server's certificate by checking if it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and is not expired or revoked.
If verification fails, the browser displays a security warning.
5. Key Exchange:

Upon successful verification, the browser generates a random symmetric encryption key and encrypts it using the server's public key.
The encrypted key is sent to the server.
6. Secure Connection Established:

The server decrypts the symmetric key using its private key.
Both the browser and server now have the symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting data.
7. API Request:

The browser constructs an API request (e.g., https://your-server.com/api/data) based on the page's resources (HTML, scripts, images, etc.).
The browser sends the API request over the established secure connection.
8. DispatcherServlet Handling:

The Spring Boot server's DispatcherServlet receives the API request.
The DispatcherServlet determines which controller's handler method should handle the request based on the URL (/api/data).
9. Controller Handling:

The appropriate controller method is executed, handling the API request.
The controller may interact with services, repositories, or other components to process the request.
10. API Response:

The controller prepares a response, typically in the form of JSON data.
The response is sent back through the secure connection to the browser.
11. Browser Rendering:

The browser receives the encrypted API response and decrypts it using the symmetric key.
The decrypted JSON data is processed and rendered as part of the web page.
In this process, the SSL/TLS handshake and certificate verification ensure that the communication between the client and server is secure and authenticated. The DispatcherServlet and controllers in the Spring Boot application handle the incoming API request and generate the appropriate response. This allows secure and reliable communication while protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.

So verification is done at browser level not on the server level right ?
=========================================================================
Yes, that's correct. The verification of the server's SSL/TLS certificate is primarily done at the browser (client) level during the SSL/TLS handshake process. The browser is responsible for validating the server's certificate to ensure its authenticity and integrity before establishing a secure connection.

Here's how the certificate verification process works:

Server Presents Certificate:
During the SSL/TLS handshake, the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate (public key) to the client (browser).

Certificate Verification by Browser:
The browser checks the server's certificate against its list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to determine if the certificate is valid and trustworthy. The verification includes several steps, such as checking if the certificate is signed by a trusted CA, if it's not expired, and if it's not revoked.

Trust Validation:
If the browser successfully verifies the server's certificate, it considers the connection secure and proceeds with the key exchange to establish the encrypted communication channel.

If the browser cannot verify the server's certificate due to issues like an expired certificate, a mismatch in the domain, or a certificate not issued by a trusted CA, it might display a security warning to the user. The user has the option to proceed or terminate the connection.

Its important to note that the verification process happens independently for each client (browser) connecting to the server. The server's role is to present its certificate and provide the necessary cryptographic operations to establish the secure connection, but the actual decision to trust the certificate lies with the client (browser).


Explain in simple Language , How PKI certificate works in an application when  I want  to use it.
=================================================================================================
Sure, let's break down how a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificate works in a simple way:

Imagine you're sending secret messages to a friend over the internet, and you want to make sure no one else can read them. A PKI certificate helps you do this by using special codes and keys.

Keys: Just like a lock and a key, a PKI certificate uses two special keys: a public key and a private key. You keep your private key super secret, like your own personal lock. Your friend can have your public key, like a lock that anyone can see.

Getting a Certificate: You get a PKI certificate from a trusted source, like a certificate authority (CA). It's like getting a special badge that says, "Hey, this is the real deal!" This badge contains your public key and some information about you.

Sending a Message:

You write your secret message and lock it with your friend's public key.
Your friend gets the message and uses their private key (their secret lock) to unlock and read it.
Because only your friend has the private key, no one else can read the message, even if they see it.
Secure Communication:

When you visit a website with a PKI certificate, your browser checks if the certificate comes from a trusted source.
If the certificate is valid, your browser knows the website is legit and can be trusted.
Then, your browser and the website exchange secret keys for encrypting and decrypting data.
This makes your communication private and secure from others trying to sneak a peek.
In an application, you can use PKI certificates to do similar things:

Securely communicate between a user's browser and your server.
Authenticate users so you know they're who they say they are.
Encrypt data to keep it safe while it travels across the internet.
Protect sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.
PKI certificates act like special locks and keys to keep your online communication safe, private, and trusted.


											Cryptography Explianed
											=======================
Plaintext / Cleartext - This is the data, unencrypted. Anybody can read.

Ciphertext - This one refers to the encrypted version of the plain same text. Noone can read until used to decrypt
by the decryption key. We can work with plaintext but we can use the ciphertext for the transferring the data in 
encrypted format.

Cipher - This is the algorithm that we would using to perform the encrytpion operation.

Cryptanalysis -  It is the process of analysing the encrypted data and trying to figure out or to decode it, to break
encypted cypher or the encryption key. It is the way to reverse engineer the encryption process.

In the world of cryptography, there are two large categories of Algorithms that deal with Hashing.

Hashing - A mathematical operation that receives a variable input, it can receives any type of input and always returns
a fixed length output. 

*Hashing is not encryption. It cannot be reversed.
*Encryption on the other hand, receives any kind of input and produces a variable lenght output in order to represent 
the encrypted version of that same input data. It can be reversed depending upon the algorithm/keys were used.

Hashing -> Hashing functions are cryptographic functions that:- 
	- takes a variable input, like it can be a word, it can be a doc, or it can be a 10 GB movie file.
	- it always produces a fixed lengh cryptographic output called a "hash".
	- Fixed length depends upon the algorithm, that can be (64, 128, 246- bits) output.
	- we will not able to reverse the operation.
	- Hashing functions is one way only.
	- the same input will always gone to present the same output but if we change a single bit or any letter, then 
	it will produce a different complete output.

We can also use them to store passwords. Normally we should never store our password in plain text.
Always store the hash of the password. It will always going to save a fixed lenght hash.
How to use it, when in web app, like register, you get username and password to store in the website then we 
will going to use any hashing functions like (md5(message digest 5), SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)).
*SHA has multiple versions, some of them are differ from the length of the output. SHA-128, SHA-256, SHA-512 etc.


* Encryption Algorithm
 ======================
Just like Hashing, encryption also takes a variable length input.
